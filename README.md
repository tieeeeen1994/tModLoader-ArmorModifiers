# Summary

This mod adds unique armor modifiers. They're not a lot, but they are super expensive to reforge. Reforing armor has different rules than what weapons or accessories have.

1. Armor will never get a modifier in any way except by reforging with the Goblin Tinkerer.
2. The base cost for reforging armor is 10 times its own value.
3. All armor modifiers are unique. They are as listed below.

- Hot: Increases attack speed by 2%.
- Turbo: Increases attack speed by 4%.
- Loose: Decreases attack speed by 4%.
- Rickety: Decreases attack speed by 2%.
- Sloppy: Decreases critical effectiveness by 40%.

- Fragile: Decreases max health by 20.
- Commoner: Decreases minion slots by 1.
